ðŸ§  VERSION 2 PSEUDO-CODE WORKSHEET 
-------------------------------------

This is our WHAT, WHEN, WHERE, HOW framework for working with data:

1. WHAT data should we store & retrieve? 
   List the key/value pair, data type, example value.

2. WHEN should we store & retrieve the data? 
   What event or user action is the trigger, such as clicking a button, submitting a form, or loading a page? 

3. WHERE does this happen in the code? 
   What component, page or function? 

4. HOW do we accomplish this? 
   What steps do we need to take? 
   Do we need to...
    - render anything in JSX? 
    - make any functions? If so, when would we call those functions? 
    - use any useState or useEffect hooks? 
    - set or get an item from localStorage? 
  Remember: This is pseudo-code. Don't write code yet â€” just outline the actions in plain language. 

âœ¨ YOUR TASK: Fill in the answers to each WHAT/WHEN/WHERE/HOW question below for the 3 pieces of data. 

------------------------
ðŸ“Š FORM DATA 
------------------------

WHAT data should we store & retrieve? 

KEY: "userData"
VALUE: formData
VALUE DATA TYPE: Object
EXAMPLE VALUE: {
        fullName: '',
        email: '',
        country:'',
        bio:''
    }

------------------------
ðŸ”¶ STORING FORM DATA 
------------------------

WHEN: User submits the form / When the user clicks submit

WHERE: Saved Countries Page / Form component

HOW: 
Step 1: In the handleSubmit() function that gets the form data,  save it in localStorage
// Use JSON.stringify() to convert the object into a string before storing it. 
    let userFormData = JSON.stringify(formData);
Step 2: Store data in local storage 
    localStorage.setItem('userInfo', userFormData)
Step 3: Print on console for testing/checking:
    console.log('userFormData : ',userFormData)
Add more steps as needed! 

------------------------
ðŸ”¶ RETRIEVING FORM DATA 
------------------------

WHEN: When user loads the Saved Countires Page

WHERE: Saved Countries Page above the form

HOW: 
Step 1: We need to make a useEffect that retrieves the Form Data on page load and saves it in state
Step 2: We render the state variable in the JSX as a heading that says "Welcome [User]!
 // Use localStorage.getItem() and JSON.parse() to get the original object back
    let userFormDataDeserialized = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('userInfo'));
Step 2:  Print on console for testing/checking:
    console.log('userFormDataDeserialized : ',userFormDataDeserialized)

Add more steps as needed! 

------------------------
ðŸ“Š SAVED COUNTRIES DATA 
------------------------

WHAT data should we store & retrieve? 

KEY: "savedCountries"
VALUE: An array of the name of countries saved
VALUE DATA TYPE: Array of Strings
EXAMPLE VALUE: [Afghanistan, India,China,]

------------------------
ðŸ”¶ STORING SAVED COUNTRIES DATA 
------------------------

WHEN: user clicks the save button on country detail page

WHERE: On the CountryDetail page by clicking on the save button(localStorage)

HOW: 
Step 1: Create an array to save countryNames using useState
Step 2: Write arrow function for the onSubmit button :  When the user clicks on the save button, call the handleSave function
Step 3: Inside the function push the countryName in the array
Step 4: Convert the array to String format
Step 3: Save the stringified data with key savedCountries in localStorage 

------------------------
ðŸ”¶ RETRIEVING SAVED COUNTRIES DATA 
------------------------

WHEN: When user goes to saved countries page /clicks the saved counytries page link

WHERE: Saved Countries page in the saved countries section

HOW: 
Step 1: Make a useEffect that runs on the page load
Step 2:  Get the array from by retrieving the key savedCountries from localStorage
Step 3: Convert back to array format using , delimiter
Step 4: Use the countriesData prop inside a for loop to find the countries in the savedCountries array and save them in an array of objects
Step 5: Render the countries on the Saved Countries page using the Country Card component ?? using map method

------------------------
ðŸ“Š COUNTRY COUNTS DATA 
------------------------

WHAT data should we store & retrieve? 

KEY: "visitedCount"
VALUE: count of how many times a country was visited
VALUE DATA TYPE: number
EXAMPLE VALUE: 2

------------------------
ðŸ”¶ STORING & RETRIEVING COUNTRY COUNTS DATA 
------------------------
NOTE: We combine storing & retrieving country counts data into one section because they always happen together. Each time we look up a countryâ€™s view count, we also need to increase it and save the new total.

WHEN: when user visits the country (Country Detail page)

WHERE: in count variable in Country Detail page and (later also set it in localStorage)

HOW: 
Step 1: Declare a useEffect function. Then on initial render retrieve "visitedCount" and save in a useState variable
Step 2: in setter function for the count in the Country Detail page, increment count by 1 (visitedCount +1)
Step 3: store the updated count in localStorage
Step 4: Set count in the state variable
Step 5: Display /Render Visited count in the JSX .
