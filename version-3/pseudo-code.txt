ðŸ§  VERSION 3 PSEUDO-CODE WORKSHEET 
-------------------------------------

This is our WHAT, WHEN, WHERE, HOW framework for working with data:

1. WHAT data should we store & retrieve? 
   What kind of HTTP request do we need to send, and to what API endpoint? 
   If we are sending a POST request, what do we need to send in the request body, and what is the data type? 
   What would we get back in the response, and what is the data type? 
  
2. WHEN should we store & retrieve the data? 
   What event or user action is the trigger, such as clicking a button, submitting a form, or loading a page? 

3. WHERE does this happen in the code? 
   What component, page or function? 

4. HOW do we accomplish this? 
   What steps do we need to take? 
   Do we need to...
    - make any GET or POST requests to an API endpoint? 
    - render anything in JSX? 
    - make any functions? If so, when would we call those functions? 
    - use any useState or useEffect hooks? 
  Remember: This is pseudo-code. Don't write code yet â€” just outline the actions in plain language. 

âœ¨ YOUR TASK: Fill in the answers to each WHAT/WHEN/WHERE/HOW question below for the 3 pieces of data. 

------------------------
ðŸ“Š FORM DATA 
------------------------

------------------------
ðŸ”¶ STORING FORM DATA 
------------------------

WHAT...
  TYPE OF HTTP REQUEST (GET OR POST): __POST__
  API ENDPOINT: __/add-one-user__

  REQUEST BODY DATA TYPE (if applicable): __Object__

  REQUEST BODY (if applicable): __{
  "name": "Alice",
  "country_name": "Germany",
  "email": "alice@example.com",
  "bio": "A little about Alice"
}
  
  RESPONSE DATA TYPE: __String__
  RESPONSE: Success! User has been added.

WHEN: __onSubmit(When user clicks Submit button after filling the form)__

WHERE: handleSubmit function in the SavedCountries.jsx file (Saved Country's Page/ Data stored in Backend (Instructor's API))

HOW: 
Step 1: Declare a new function called addOneUser which should send a POST request to the API to the /add-one-user endpoint
Step 2: Call the addOneUser() function on submit ( in handleSubmit function)

------------------------
ðŸ”¶ RETRIEVING FORM DATA 
------------------------
WHAT...
  TYPE OF HTTP REQUEST (GET OR POST): __GET__
  API ENDPOINT: __/get-newest-user__

  REQUEST BODY DATA TYPE (if applicable): __Not applicable__
  REQUEST BODY (if applicable): __Not applicable__
  
  RESPONSE DATA TYPE: __Array of Objects__
  RESPONSE: [
  {
    "user_id": 42,
    "name": "John Smith",
    "country_name": "Canada",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "bio": "Another bio"
  }
]
  
WHEN: on page load (User visits the saved Countries page)

WHERE: useEffect() in the SavedCountries.jsx file (Saved Country's Page/ Data retrieved from Backend (Instructor's API))

HOW: 
Step 1: Make a function called getNewestUser() that will get the form data from the API by sending a GET request to the /get-newest-user-endpoint 
Step 2: Save the form data in a state variable using useState() 
Step 3: Call the getNewestUser() function on page load in the useEffect()
Step 4: Conditionally render the user's name in the return statement (in JSX) if the user's name exists

ðŸ“Š SAVED COUNTRIES DATA 
------------------------

------------------------
ðŸ”¶ STORING SAVED COUNTRIES DATA 
------------------------

WHAT...
  TYPE OF HTTP REQUEST (GET OR POST): __POST__

}
  
  RESPONSE DATA TYPE: __String__
  RESPONSE: Success! The country is saved.

WHEN: When user clicks the save button 

WHERE: handleSave() function in the CountryDetail.jsx file (Country Detail Page)

HOW: 
Step 1: _______
Step 2: _______
Step 3: _______
Add more steps as needed!

ðŸ”¶ RETRIEVING SAVED COUNTRIES DATA 
------------------------

WHAT...
  TYPE OF HTTP REQUEST (GET OR POST): __GET__

  REQUEST BODY (if applicable): __Not applicable__
  
  RESPONSE DATA TYPE: __Array of Objects__
  RESPONSE: [
  {
    "country_name": "Japan"

  {
    "country_name": "Germany"
  }
]

WHEN: User clicks on the Saved Countries Page

WHERE: useEffect() in the SavedCountries.jsx file Saved Countries Page

HOW: 
Step 1: Declare an asyn function with url to get savedCountries data
Step 2: convert the response to json
Step 3: render the countries on page
Add more steps as needed!

ðŸ“Š COUNTRY COUNTS DATA 
------------------------

------------------------
ðŸ”¶ STORING & RETRIEVING COUNTRY COUNTS DATA 
------------------------
NOTE: We combine storing & retrieving country counts data into one section because they always happen together. Each time we look up a countryâ€™s view count, we also need to increase it and save the new total.

WHAT...
  TYPE OF HTTP REQUEST (GET OR POST): __POST__
  API ENDPOINT: __/update-one-country-count__

  REQUEST BODY DATA TYPE (if applicable): __Object__
  REQUEST BODY (if applicable):{
  "country_name": "France"
}
  
  RESPONSE DATA TYPE: __Object__
  RESPONSE: {
  "count": 3
}
  
WHEN: User visits/views the country by clicking on the country

WHERE: Functions useEffect() in the CountryDetail.jsx (Country Detail Page)

HOW: 
Step 1: _______
Step 2: _______
Step 3: _______
